# WWDC-A2

GENERAL INFO
My project includes a (still in progress) prototype for a fun and interactice video game coded in python. This will include my 1000 word reflection referencing the last 6-7 weeks of work that has gone into this project, the resources I used to create this project whilst also referencing the academic sources that influenced me in this process. It will also include a 3-minute explainer video going through the details of my project, the aim of the game, how it works and the functionality of my coding choices. 

TECHNOLOGIES USED
I used Microsoft's MakeCode Arcade website to create this prototype. The options to code in both python and in blocks made the creation process a lot easier as I was able to visual the code and was more able to see issues in lines of code that otherwise may have been difficult to identity. 

FEATURES
Some of the main elements featured in this protoype include a bouncing effect on object and having object's disappear as they are 'caught' by the main player. Both elements proved extremely difficult to create however were absolutely necessary for the video game. 

PROJECT STATUS AND POSSIBILITES FOR IMPROVEMENT 
As this is just a prototype still in progress, there are still a few elements missing that would hopefully be included in the final version included multiple levels that alter a players perameters to win and ultimately makes the game more challenging as it continues. 

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
This project was loosely inspired by my favourite childhood video game, fruit ninja. I was influenced to use fruits as my main sprites for this protoype as it indludes a creates of nostalgia for myself and peers who may have also played it growing up. This project is based upon learnings in Week 5's in class tutorial were we learnt the foundations of coding in python on Microsoft's MakeCode Arcade.
