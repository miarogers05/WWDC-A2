# WWDC-A2

My project includes a (still in progress) prototype for a fun and interactice video game coded in python. This will include my 1000 word reflection referencing the last 6-7 weeks of work that has gone into this project, the resources I used to create this project whilst also referencing the academic sources that influenced me in this process. It will also include a 3-minute explainer video going through the details of my project, the aim of the game, how it works and the functionality of my coding choices.
